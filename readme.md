What is a CRUD API?
When building an API, we want our model to provide four basic functionalities which are the four major functions 
used to interact with database applications in which we refer to as create, read, update, and delete
resources known as CRUD. This CRUD is essential operations needed in building an endpoint API.

RESTful APIs most commonly utilize HTTP requests. Four of the most common HTTP methods in a REST environment are GET, POST,
PUT, and DELETE, which are the methods by which a developer can create a CRUD system.

Create: Use the HTTP POST method to create a resource in a REST environment
Read: Use the GET method to read a resource, retrieving data without altering it
Update: Use the PUT method to update a resource
Delete: Use the DELETE method to remove a resource from the system
